## Arrays

### 1. Creating Arrays
There are two main ways to create an array-like structure in Python 3:

1. Using Lists:

Lists are the most common way to store collections of elements in Python. They are versatile and can hold elements of different data types. Here's how to create a list:

```python

# Empty list
my_list = []

# List with elements
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# List with all elements set to the same value (using list comprehension)
numbers = [5] * 3  # Creates [5, 5, 5]

```

2. Using the array module (for more specific data types):

The array module offers arrays that store elements of a single data type for memory efficiency. You'll need to import the module first.

```python
from array import *

# Array of integers
int_array = array('i', [1, 2, 3])

# Array of floating-point numbers
float_array = array('d', [3.14, 2.72])

```
Choosing between Lists and Arrays:

Use lists for general-purpose collections where data type flexibility is important.
Use arrays from the array module when you need a fixed size and efficient storage for elements of the same data type.

### 2. Iterate Arrays

1. Using a for loop:

This is the most common and straightforward way. The loop iterates over each element in the array.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
  print(fruit)

```

2. Using a for loop with range and index:

This approach iterates using the index of each element.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for i in range(len(fruits)):
  print(f"Fruit at index {i} is {fruits[i]}")

```

3. Using enumerate():

This built-in function returns an enumerate object that yields tuples containing the index and element in each iteration.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
  print(f"Fruit at index {index} is {fruit}")

```

4. Using list comprehension (for modifying the array):

List comprehension offers a concise way to iterate and potentially modify the elements.

```python

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
capitalized_fruits = [fruit.upper() for fruit in fruits]
print(capitalized_fruits)  # Output: ["APPLE", "BANANA", "CHERRY"]

```
Choosing the right method:

Use a for loop when you simply need to access each element.
Use a for loop with range for situations where the element's index is important.
Use enumerate() when you need both the index and the element.
Use list comprehension for concisely creating a new list based on the original array.
